1. Get a deck of cards. you would need your brain for math and thats about it, maybe a shuffler if your fancy enough to have one.
2. 1.Deal 9 cards. 
    2.You check for pairs in the dealt cards, either ace ten, 9 two, 8 three, 7 4,6 5, or jack queen king.
    3.If there are no pairs you lose 
    4.If there is a pair take a pair and replace that pair with two or three new cards if its JQK and restart the algorithim from step 2. 
    5.If the deck has been fully dealed and there are no cards on the table you win
3. Yes
    1. In ElevensBoard Function
    2. In the is legal function
    3. just returns a list minus all the null values.  J, 6, 2, A, 4
    4. for(int k = 0; k<selected.length; k++){
        card[k].toString();
    }
    5. The is legal function because it needs to make sure there are 9 cards on the board first
